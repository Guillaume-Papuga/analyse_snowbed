# Mediterranean temporary lagoon
## An analysis of habitat distribution

**by Aubin Allies, Mathilde Latron, Guillaume Papuga**

*Last update: April 2020*

Mediterranean temporary lagoons are habitats of high conservation value. They host several protected plants and constitute nesting sites to many birds, including limicolous.
Yet, numerous alterations induced by human activities have severely altered such habitat, whose good ecological status relies on the complex interaction of hydrological and pedological parameters. 
To improve our understanding of such complex systems, we built a project to investigate the ecology of Mediterranean Temporary Lagoons that include the University of Montpellier, the Mediterranean Botanical Conservatory, and the Tour du Valat Research centre. 

Here we develop a method to map this peculiar habitat in the south of France, based on ecological rasters calculated from Sentinel images. 

This model is part of a scientific article currently underwriting.
